                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>I was born in 1989 and raised in Tyler/East Texas. I grew up playing football
                    and baseball, while always having my eyes on the military. My grandfather served
                    in the Navy during WWII and to this day is still my hero and my reason for joining
                    the military.</p>
                
                <p>In high school, I joined the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps were I got my first
                    of the military. I did training with active duty Navy in Roswell AFB and Kingville NAS.
                    During Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, I took part in "Operation Rita" and received a <em>Certificate
                    of Commendation</em> from the Texas State Guard's <strong>Texas Medical Rangers</strong>, for
                    providing medical assistance and security aide for evacuees during the huricanes.</p>
                
                <p>The summer before my senior year of High School, I became a volunteer firefighter and on my
                    17th birthday I enlisted in the Marine Corps. I graduated from Whitehouse High School in 2007 and
                    left for boot camp on October 15, 2007.</p>

                <h2>Marine Corps</h2>
                <p>I graduated from MCRD San Diego in January of 2008 and afer completing MCT, I reported to my MOS
                    school at MCCES on MCB 29 Palms, CA. I spent nearly a year and half at communications and electronics
                    school there before graduating as an Aviation Communication Systems Repair Technician and then reporting
                    to MTACS-38 at MCAS Miramar, CA.</p> 
                
                <p>Although I was trained as a maintainer, I spent most of my time as a radio
                    operator on numurous training missions before finally getting orders for Afghanistan. Unfortunately, my long
                    awaited deployment and career in the Marine Corps was cut short due to a training mishap that nearly broke my
                    back and almost paralyzed. Just shy of 2  and half years in and I was discharged and I am now 90% disabled by
                    the VA.</p>

            <section class='section section--education'>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>After the Marine Corps, I enrolled in Vocational Rehabillitation and enrolled in college. I obtained my Associates 
                   of Arts in History and attended the University of Texas at Tyler to pursue my Bachelors of Art in History and a minor
                   in International Relations. Coding first caught my interest in high school when I took computer science and learned
                   rudimentary JavaScript, but the military was my part so I did't pursue it any further at that time.</p> 

                <p>The past couple years I have been trying to get back into college with an attempt to get back into coding, but have met with several
                   roadblocks, until a couple months ago I came across <em><strong>VetsWhoCode</strong></em> and decided to apply in an
                   to reignite and old interest and possible future career path.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Since I grew up playing sports, it gave me a love for being outside in nature and with it lots of hobbies that evolved as I grew older.
                    August 3rd, I competed in the Neches Wilderness Race where I raced a kayak down the Neches river in East Texas.</p>
                
                    
                <ul>Just a few other hobbies I enjoy:
                    <li>Hunting</li>
                    <li>Fishing</li>
